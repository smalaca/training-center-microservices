## Decision

Use Port and Adapter Architecture (Hexagonal Architecture) for the Training Management module.

## Context

* We are developing the Training Management module, which is responsible for managing training proposals and programs.
* This module is a core part of our business, handling critical operations such as creating, updating, accepting, and rejecting training proposals, as well as updating and withdrawing training programs.
* The module needs to interact with external systems (e.g., Kafka for event publishing) and persistence mechanisms (e.g., H2 database).
* We need to ensure that the domain logic remains isolated from these external concerns to maintain maintainability, testability, and flexibility.

## Solutions

### Port and Adapter Architecture (Hexagonal Architecture)

* Isolate the domain logic from external concerns using ports (interfaces) and adapters (implementations).
* The domain core contains the business logic and defines ports for interacting with external systems.
* Adapters implement these ports and handle the details of interacting with external systems.
* Promotes a clear separation between domain logic and infrastructure concerns.

### Layered Architecture

* Organize the code into layers (e.g., presentation, application, domain, infrastructure).
* Each layer depends on the layers below it.
* May lead to tighter coupling between layers compared to port and adapters.

### Feature-based Architecture

* Organize the code by features rather than technical concerns.
* Each feature contains all the necessary code (presentation, domain, infrastructure) to implement a specific functionality.
* May lead to code duplication and less clear separation of concerns.

## Decision Rationale

* **Domain Isolation** - Port and Adapter architecture effectively isolates the core domain logic from external concerns, making it easier to test, maintain, and evolve independently.
* **Testability** - By using interfaces (ports) for external dependencies, we can easily mock these dependencies in tests, allowing for more focused and reliable unit tests.
* **Flexibility** - The architecture allows us to change the implementation details of external systems (e.g., switching from H2 to another database) without affecting the domain logic.
* **Clear Boundaries** - The architecture establishes clear boundaries between the domain and infrastructure, making the codebase more maintainable and easier to understand.
* **Alignment with CQRS** - The architecture complements our CQRS approach by providing a clear structure for separating the command (write) side of the application.

## Consequences

* **Increased Initial Development Time** - Implementing Port and Adapter architecture might require more upfront design effort and potentially more code (interfaces, adapters) compared to simpler architectures.
* **Learning Curve** - Developers unfamiliar with the architecture might need time to understand the concepts and patterns.

### Positive Risks and Considerations

* Improved code quality, maintainability, and testability.
* Enhanced flexibility and adaptability to changing requirements or infrastructure.
* Clearer separation of concerns, leading to a more understandable codebase.
* Better alignment with domain-driven design principles.

### Negative Risks and Considerations

* Potential for over-engineering if not implemented judiciously.
* Risk of creating unnecessary abstractions that add complexity without providing value.
* Increased initial development time due to the need for more interfaces and adapter implementations.
