## Decision

Use Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) pattern for the Training Management and Training Portfolio modules.

## Context

* We are developing two new modules: Training Management and Training Portfolio.
* Training Management is responsible for managing training proposals and programs, including creating, updating, accepting, rejecting, and withdrawing them.
* Training Portfolio is responsible for providing a read-optimized view of training programs.
* We need to choose an architecture pattern that allows for efficient write operations in the Training Management module and optimized read operations with filtering, sorting, and pagination in the Training Portfolio module.

## Solutions

### Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS)

* Separate the write (command) and read (query) responsibilities into different models and potentially different services.
* The write model focuses on handling commands and maintaining data consistency.
* The read model is optimized for query performance and can be denormalized for specific query needs.
* Changes in the write model are propagated to the read model through events.

### Traditional CRUD Architecture

* Use the same model for both write and read operations.
* Simpler to implement but may lead to compromises in either write or read performance.
* May become complex when trying to optimize for both write and read operations simultaneously.

### Event Sourcing with CQRS

* Store all changes to the application state as a sequence of events.
* Combine with CQRS to rebuild the read model from the event stream.
* Provides excellent auditability but adds complexity.

## Decision Rationale

* **Separation of Concerns** - CQRS allows us to separate the write operations (Training Management) from the read operations (Training Portfolio), enabling each module to be optimized for its specific purpose.
* **Scalability** - By separating read and write operations, we can scale each independently based on their respective loads.
* **Query Optimization** - The read model in Training Portfolio can be specifically designed for efficient querying, including support for pagination, filtering, and sorting.
* **Consistency Model** - CQRS allows for eventual consistency between the write and read models, which is acceptable for our use case where real-time consistency is not critical.
* **Event-Driven Architecture** - CQRS naturally fits with our event-driven approach, where events from the Training Management module trigger updates in the Training Portfolio module.

## Consequences

* **Increased Complexity** - Implementing CQRS introduces additional complexity compared to a traditional CRUD architecture.
* **Eventual Consistency** - There may be a delay between when a change is made in the write model and when it's reflected in the read model.
* **Multiple Models** - Maintaining separate models for reading and writing requires additional development and maintenance effort.

### Positive Risks and Considerations

* Improved performance for both read and write operations.
* Better scalability and flexibility.
* Clearer separation of concerns, leading to more maintainable code.
* Ability to evolve the read and write models independently.

### Negative Risks and Considerations

* Potential for increased development time and complexity.
* Need for careful design of the event propagation mechanism.
* Risk of inconsistency between the write and read models if events are not properly processed.
