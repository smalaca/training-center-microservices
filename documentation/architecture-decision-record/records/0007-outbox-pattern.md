# 0007: Outbox Pattern for Reliable Event Publishing

## Status

## Decision

Implement the Outbox Pattern to ensure reliable event publishing in our event-driven architecture.

## Context

* Our system uses an event-driven architecture where services communicate through events.
* Ensuring reliable event delivery is critical for maintaining data consistency across services.
* We need to avoid the dual-write problem where a service might update its database but fail to publish an event.
* Events must be published exactly once to avoid duplicate processing.
* The system should be resilient to temporary failures in the messaging infrastructure.

## Solutions

### Outbox Pattern

* When a service needs to publish an event, it first stores the event in an "outbox" table within its own database as part of the same transaction that updates the service's state.
* A separate process periodically polls the outbox table for unpublished events, publishes them to the message broker, and marks them as published.
* This ensures that the database update and event creation are atomic, and the event will eventually be published even if there are temporary failures.

### Direct Publishing

* Services publish events directly to the message broker after updating their database.
* This approach is simpler but can lead to inconsistencies if the event publishing fails after the database update succeeds.

### Two-Phase Commit

* Use a distributed transaction protocol to ensure atomicity between the database update and event publishing.
* This approach is complex and may not be supported by all message brokers.

## Decision Rationale

* **Data Consistency** - The outbox pattern ensures that database updates and event publishing are atomic, preventing inconsistencies.
* **Reliability** - Events are guaranteed to be published even if there are temporary failures in the messaging infrastructure.
* **Exactly-Once Semantics** - The pattern helps ensure that events are published exactly once, avoiding duplicate processing.
* **Simplicity** - The pattern is relatively simple to implement and doesn't require distributed transactions.
* **Compatibility** - The pattern works with any message broker and doesn't require special transaction support.

## Consequences

* **Increased Latency** - There may be a delay between the database update and the event being published, as the outbox processor runs periodically.
* **Additional Complexity** - The system needs an additional component to poll the outbox and publish events.
* **Database Load** - The outbox table and polling process add some load to the database.

### Positive Risks and Considerations

* The pattern naturally provides an audit trail of all events that have been published.
* The pattern can be extended to support event ordering and idempotent processing.
* The outbox table can be used for debugging and monitoring purposes.

### Negative Risks and Considerations

* If the outbox processor fails for an extended period, there may be a large backlog of events to process.
* The pattern requires careful handling of failures in the outbox processor to avoid lost or duplicate events.
* Additional monitoring is needed to ensure the outbox processor is functioning correctly.
