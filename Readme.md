## 🎯 Project Goal
This repository demonstrates how to build and maintain a modern microservices architecture following best practices and industry-standard patterns:

- **Microservices Architecture** - Decomposing a complex domain into manageable, independently deployable services
- **Event Storming** - Collaborative domain exploration technique to identify bounded contexts
- **Port and Adapters Architecture** (Hexagonal) - Separation of business logic from external concerns
- **Domain-Driven Design** - Designing software to reflect the business domain and ubiquitous language
